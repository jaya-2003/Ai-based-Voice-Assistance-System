# Ai-based-Voice-Assistance-System
Proposed system aims to develop a python-assistant (PA) as a desktop application. PA draws its inspiration from virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows, and Siri for iOS. It has been designed to provide a user-friendly interaction for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with the assistant either through voice commands or using keyboard input. As a personal assistant, PA assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general human conversation, searching queries in a browser, searching for videos, retrieving images, live weather conditions, word meanings, searching for medicine details, health recommendations based on symptoms and reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks. The user statements/commands are analyzed with the help of predefined models to give an optimal solution.

We are well aware about Cortana, Siri, Google Assistant and many other virtual assistants which are designed for specific platforms such as Windows, Android and iOS platforms. There is no specific virtual assistant which is platform independent. So we decided to work on a specific application which is platform independent. 

Our virtual assistant is a desktop assistant that uses speech recognition. It can understand and carry out the audio instructions given by the user. I don't have to worry about using input devices like the keyboard and mouse, so we'll use them less. It also saves the user a lot of time. We process these commands using some of the pre-defined python modules like-Speech Recognition, pyttsx3, PyAudio….etc.
